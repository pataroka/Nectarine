                    <span class="name">The Great Pindar Svetlin Nakov</span>
                    Founder and final boss of the Software Illuminati Nakov ‘s dreams go beyond  every man’s imagination.
                    His goal is to make Bulgaria the most IT advanced country in the world  and use that to take over the
                    world bringing The New World Order. Svetlin is powerful, arrogant and crushes his enemies source code to bits.
                    I there is something this titan can’t do thats finding the ANY key.

                    <span class="name">Angel Georgiev</span>
                    The smartest man in the organization and Nakov’s right hand Angel’s IQ is so high that
                    few times in his life he managed to win a argument against compilator .
                    To be honest I’ve never seen him to anything productive for the organization
                    besides this one time he succeeded   hiding all Nakov’s weed in the basement from the
                    policeman who visited the building.

                    <span class="name">Bogomil Dimitrov</span>
                    Bogomil is SoftUni Illuminati’s boy for everything.
                    He brings coffee to the whole office in the morning and  massages Nakov’s
                    feet when asked to.  Mr. Dimitrov is probably the only one who realizes how
                    stupid the idea behind the organization is but he accepted Nakov’s offer to join
                    the council  because he needed the money . Later on he found out that the council meetings can be
                    great resource for his upcoming book “Software Engineers:  The Stupidity”.

                    <span class="name">Borislav Hristov</span>
                    Borislav is SoftUni Illuminati’s network engineer a.k.a the man responsible for everything that happens outside
                    the building. He knows the browser history of every single member in the organization that’s why everyone
                    panics when he is out of his office (by office I mean 2 by 2 meters dark hole).
                    Someone once told me that he got a message from alien civilization and wrote in down on a piece of paper
                    but then he got distracted by the new Justin Bieber video and lost the note.

                    <span class="name">Deqn Dachev</span>
                    Dido is one of the craziest people you’ll ever get the chance to meet.
                    Nakov hired him to be SoftIlluminati’s activity manager
                    (The only line of code Dido can write is : Console.WriteLine(“Hello world;”) ).
                    And by activity manager I mean gathering the whole building in the gym  and playing
                    Ping-Pong with Nakov while the rest of the members play Angry Birds on their phones.

                    <span class="name">Hristo Chakarov</span>
                    Nobody knows what is he doing in the council not even Nakov.
                    All we know about him that he spends most of the time coding but no one knows exactly what.
                    He doesn’t speak often in meetings but when he does every single one of his sentences
                    shows that he is IT specialist:  everything Hristo says is technically correct,
                    but It's of no use to anyone. I was told that someone saw him eating glue.

                    <span class="name">Ivan Yonkov</span>
                    Yonkov is the creator of the organization’s website
                    (No! Not this one ! Wait.. what? Illuminati confirmed!) .
                    He is also known for being intense keyboard ninja .
                    Always ready to argue on the forums for basically everything.
                    There  is one day of the year when Ivan organizes debate on different
                    Illuminati topics and the only one  who shows up to work that  day is Angel
                    (I hear that they almost killed each other  over argument once ).

                    <span class="name">Ivan Vankov</span>
                    He is like one of the Jehovah’s  Witnesses but instead of going to people’s houses asking to talk
                    with them about Jesus he goes to people’s offices in the building asking them if they have time to
                    talk about why Linux is better than Windows. My sources tell me that he got his place in the
                    council by winning Linux’s contest for best fan art logo with his drawing of handicapped penguin.
                    Ivan’s coding skills are limited to drawing triangles in console with java.

                    <span class="name">Marian Marinov</span>
                    Just look at this wonderful gentleman in a white suit.
                    Can you believe that he once was convicted for breaking into 5 government’s servers.
                    Marian is one of the masterminds in the organization that keep everything running while
                    everyone else are drinking beers and scratching their backs. When I once asked me why he
                    was late for work Mr. Marinov answered that he had to spend 1hr beating his wife around the kitchen
                    because his breakfast was cold (you don't want to to mess with this guy).

                    <span class="name">Mario Peshev</span>
                    You know that every organization or company have that one weirdo who annoys everyone to death?
                    That’s our guy! Mario is bearded weirdo who always comes to work with the same t-shirt that says
                    “Your mother is so fat that the recursive function calculating her mass causes stack overflow”
                    and he always makes jokes about it. He hardly does any work and spends most of the time playing StarCraft 2.
                    I remember  that  once there was a time where he cried in his office for 2 weeks when he lost a game.

                    <span class="name">Nikolay Bankin</span>
                    This individual is mostly known for saying “WTF is this crap?” Why?
                    Well his role in the organization is to review everyone’s code and make sure everything is
                    working correctly which is rare occasion. From times to times Niki is teaching
                    and when that happens he spends half of the lecture telling the students why he loves Mozilla
                    and how he doesn’t even have Chrome on his computer (suck it Chrome peasants).

                    <span class="name">Stoyan Stoyanov</span>
                    Stoyan is the head teacher in the academy and as such he have granted spot in the council.
                    No one in the council likes him because he talks way too much.
                    Nakov told me that in the last meeting he spent 2 hours trying to convince the rest of the council
                    that they need to change  the type of toilet  paper in the building toilets  and by the time he was
                    done talking half of the man in the room were asleep and the other half were playing poker .

                    Vladi is the organization’s priest when he is not teaching the ideology of the Illuminati to
                    the students he spends most of the time in his desk writing some really weird binary crap in his note.
                    When I once asked him what he is writing I was told that this will be the Illuminati bible (weird I know).

                    <span class="name">Yordan Darakchiev</span>
                    This is the toilet cleaner and the only reason he is in the council is because the lack of members.
                    Danacho won the award employee of the month once when he was the only man paying attention to Stoyan
                    during his talk about the type of toilet paper used in the toilets.
